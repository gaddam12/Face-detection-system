# Face-detection-system

### **1. Introduction**

Face mask detection is an application of computer vision that determines whether a person in an image or video stream is wearing a mask or not.
This project was developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where wearing face masks became a public health necessity. The solution aims to help organizations, public places, and transport services enforce mask compliance using AI-powered systems.


### **2. Objective**

The main objective of this project is to:

* Automatically detect faces in an image or video stream.
* Classify each detected face as **“Mask”** or **“No Mask”**.
* Provide a real-time alert or display results for monitoring purposes.


### **3. Dataset**

For this project, we use a publicly available dataset containing labeled images of people with and without masks.

* **Size:** \~3,000 to 12,000 images (depending on the dataset source).
* **Classes:**

  1. **With Mask** – Images of people wearing a proper face mask.
  2. **Without Mask** – Images of people not wearing any mask.
* **Sources:** Kaggle datasets or custom image scraping.

### **4. Methodology**

#### **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**

* Resize all images to a fixed dimension (e.g., 224×224 pixels).
* Normalize pixel values to improve training efficiency.
* Apply data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom, brightness change) to improve generalization.

#### **Step 2: Model Architecture**

The detection system can be implemented using:

* **Deep Learning Model:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as MobileNetV2, ResNet-50, or custom CNN architecture.
* **Face Detection:** Use OpenCV’s `cv2.CascadeClassifier` or a deep learning–based detector like MTCNN or Dlib to locate faces.
* **Classification Layer:** The CNN classifies each detected face into two categories — *Mask* or *No Mask*.

#### **Step 3: Training**

* **Loss Function:** Binary Crossentropy.
* **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate (e.g., 0.0001).
* **Batch Size:** Typically 32.
* **Epochs:** 20–50, depending on convergence.

#### **Step 4: Evaluation**

* Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are calculated on the test set.
* Confusion matrix is plotted to analyze misclassifications.

#### **Step 5: Real-Time Prediction**

* Integrate with OpenCV to capture frames from a webcam.
* Detect faces in each frame, classify them, and display bounding boxes with labels (“Mask” or “No Mask”).


### **5. Tools and Technologies**

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
* **Hardware:** GPU recommended for faster training
* **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code


### **6. Applications**

* Monitoring in public places like airports, railway stations, and malls.
* Workplace safety compliance.
* Automated gate or door systems that deny entry without masks.



### **7. Possible Enhancements**

* Adding a **“Improper Mask”** class for masks worn incorrectly.
* Deployment as a **web app** using Flask or FastAPI.
* Integration with **Raspberry Pi** for embedded systems.
* Using YOLOv8 or EfficientDet for faster real-time detection.
